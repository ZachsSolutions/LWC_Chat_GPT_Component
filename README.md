# LWC_Chat_GPT_Component
This is a LWC component built for simple question and answer interaction with OpenAI

The component is fairly straight forward, the only changes that are needed to be made for configuration has to do with changing the API endpoint and the Secret Key in the JS file.  

The component also requires adding 'https://api.openai.com' to the Remote Site Settings of the target org. 

CSS and HTMl to be improved in the 2.0 !
